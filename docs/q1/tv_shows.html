                <li>Sketch Comedy has a significantly higher average number of seasons in comparison to all other genres.</li>
                <li>More than 85% of TV shows have no more than 3 seasons.</li>
                <li>Interestingly, Soap Opera / Melodramas have a relatively high number of seasons in comparison to the other genres, but still falls below quite a few genres such as Late Night or Sitcom, which was interesting to see as soap operas are quite renown for having various seasons and numerous episodes. This potentially suggests that there might be less episodes per season for the other genres, but we'll have to find out. </li>
